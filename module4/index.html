  <h1>Module 4 Solution Starter</h1>
  <p> The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate an understanding of Javascript. This site does not do much on the surface so to get the full effect you must use view the console with the developer tools.  To get the console, right click on this text and use the 'Inspect Element' option. </p>
  <br>
  <p>With the console open, you can view the output of this project. The code loops through a series of names and either prints hello or good-bye.  If the name starts with a J its good-bye otherwise it prints hello. </p>
  <br>
  <p>An incomplete code file was provided as the base of the assignment. My job was to debug the code so the functions would work.

  <p> Thanks for reading!</p>
